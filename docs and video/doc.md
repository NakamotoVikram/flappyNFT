#flappyNFT Project Summary
flappyNFT is a blockchain-based gaming and NFT project demonstrating the integration of Zilliqa blockchain technology and its ZRC-1 NFT STandard into a real-world game. 

The project demonstrates two themes, one where we demonstrate the Conversion of in-game assets to NFTs and two demonstrating Generative Art Piece (of the special type generated based on bird DNA + creation of animated gaming NFT sprite sheet asset which itself is our unique value addition).

Finally, the entire project converts both these two themes into one demonstrating even a more dynamic use case around Zilliqa blockchain, Gaming, and NFTs.

[Few out of scope ideas proposed]
We demonstrate an idea for an in-game advertisement where brands could advertise their logo and the revenue generated could be used to incentivize users and developers. The idea itself being a big separate module and out of the scope of this hackathon is partially demonstrated in this hackathon project by advertising logos of some amazing Zilliqa Projects into the game.
